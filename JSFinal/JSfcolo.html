            Hello! I am Alseng, a <br>physical and digital artist.
            <br>I picked up drawing as a <br> hobby in 7th grade, starting <br> with realism portraits of my <br>favorite actors.
            From then on, <br> I've continued to grow <br> and hone my skills.
            <br>This page includes all of my <br> recent artwork ranging from <br>high school to now; my Junior <br>year at the University of Colorado <br>Boulder.

                  During production of the first season of my webcomic, I started studying different lighting techniques.
                  This is the yellow-blue study using Dazai and Chuuya from the anime Bungo Stray Dogs. It was also a study in shading, which I really like how this one turned out.

                  This piece is the first of 2 for my first college art final. I wanted to try something completely new.
                  I had seen a peer create a drawing with the same effect back in high school and was determined to make my own.
                  <br>Using colored pencils on black paper, I drew this dragon and colored him with red and blue.
                  In the next two images, you'll see the red filter and the blue filter.

                   This is the dragon with a blue filter on. This version was my main focus, making sure the red disappeared as much as possible 
                   so that the dragon's skeleton was clear.

                    This is the second piece in my art final in color study. I was a lot more ambitious now that I knew how to 
                    get the right effect. Drawing almost a full-body image, I had much more difficulty in making sure that the skeleton was clear and filled the space it was supposed to.
                    I also added new plants to add to the effect.
