            Hello! I am Alseng, a <br>physical and digital artist.
            <br>I picked up drawing as a <br> hobby in 7th grade, starting <br> with realism portraits of my <br>favorite actors.
            From then on, <br> I've continued to grow <br> and hone my skills.
            <br>This page includes all of my <br> recent artwork ranging from <br>high school to now; my Junior <br>year at the University of Colorado <br>Boulder.

                <p>
                    Taking my character Vivian from the novel that I am currently writing,<br>
                    I chose to draw her in her two different worlds. The left being the real <br>world, 
                    where she isn't exactly 'grounded.' Meanwhile, the right is the <br>virtual world that she created, 
                    where she is in the scene herself and part<br> of their lives.
                    <br>
                    Using colored pencil to bring life and personality to the characters, I <br>was able to draw the viewer's 
                    eyes from the top left corner to the <br>bottom right. Thus, every aspect can be seen to its fullest.

                    was a lot of work, but I like the <br>way it turned out.

                    My first still life of college in the study of texture. Organic, metal, <br>glass, and fabric.
                     The vase in particular was a struggle with all of its <br>warping of the surroundings. However, I still enjoy how 
                     this turned out.

                    Using plastic models, bones, and light fixtures as the model, I created <br>this piece. 
                    I was told not to shade, which drove me crazy. Having only <br>drawn shaded portraits before, I struggled a lot with this factor.
                     In the <br>end, I really like how it turned out.

                    Using the shapes from my Line Models piece, I was told to create a <br>new piece that studies positive and negative spaces.
                     So, I descided to <br>go a step further and study life V.S. metal. Using a flat checkerboard <br>on the metal pieces, and lively flowers on the living, 
                    I was able to pull <br>it off with curves lines on the bones for a middle ground.

                    Another study in texture with still lifes; cloth, plastic, metal, wood, and <br>glass. Finally being able to shade, this piece was a lot of fun for me.
                    I <br>only wish I could get better highlights.

                    This was done in my high school years, where I had a lot of freedom to <br>decide what to draw and which materials to use.
                    Having always drawn <br>on white paper, I decided to try something new. Using black paper <br>and white charcoal, my world was suddenly upside down.
                    This <br>character is Shima Renzou from the anime Blue Exorcist. I was trying <br>my hands at more cartoon-style drawings and Shima was my top <br>character at the time.
                    I love how this piece turned out and will <br>definately do more white charcoal works in the future.
