            Hello! I am Alseng, a <br>physical and digital artist.
            <br>I picked up drawing as a <br> hobby in 7th grade, starting <br> with realism portraits of my <br>favorite actors.
            From then on, <br> I've continued to grow <br> and hone my skills.
            <br>This page includes all of my <br> recent artwork ranging from <br>high school to now; my Junior <br>year at the University of Colorado <br>Boulder.

                    <p>
                        After writing over 120 pages of my first novel, I gathered the courage to draw the main character; Clive Bayker and his familiar Claire.
                        Clive can use magic of all four elements; fire, air, water, and earth. In this image he is using air (green swirls) and fire. His familiar is a mythical snow leopard
                        with wings named Claire. Together they protect and defend their fellow Elementals against the evil Warlocks; normal humans who want to study and experiment on them.
                        <br>
                        This piece was the first of a series of digital experiments. I had never done anything so detailed in Photoshop before, so I'm really happy with how it turned out.

                        This is my second concept with Clive and Claire. This time I added in a very special character called Destiny.
                        I wanted to focus on the amount of distrust Clive has with Destiny, so I placed Destiny with his back to us and gave Clive the appropriate expression.

                    <p>
                        This is the main character of another novel I am writing. Silas is a sorcer with the ability to summon weapons.
                        He was given the task to go undercover within the School of Sorcery to find the traitor amongst them.
                        During the day he's just a normal student, but by night he's a full-fledge Sorcerer, fighting monsters and defending the weak.
                        I wanted to show his day and night differences with day on the left and night on the right.

                      This is the concept of yet another character from my novels. Her name is Sophie and she was abandoned at birth and taken in by her dragon mother Frost.
                       Born with special powers, she eventually developed the abilities of a dragon after living with one all her life.
                        Of course, she grew to have the attitude of one too.
