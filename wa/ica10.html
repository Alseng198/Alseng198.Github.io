        "Yours is a long road, my friend, and it stretches on to places beyond imagining.
With your every step, these grand adventures shall grow more distant and faint.
And there may come a day when you forget the faces and voices of those you have met along the way.
On that day, I bid you remember this...
That no matter how far your journey may take you, you stand where you stand by virtue of the road you walked to get there.
For in times of hardship, when you fear you cannot go on...
The joy you have known, the pain you have felt, the prayers you have whispered and answered—they shall ever be your strength and your comfort.
This I hope—I believe, here at memory's end."
